Recently I took a course which introduced me to the very low language of
Assembly languge. As I went through the process of disassembling, debugging,
analyzing and understanding assembly code, I realized something. I know
nothing about Computers. 

And so after my very first conscious thought, I decided to make this
repository. The main goals of this repository are:
- Get comfortable using CLI
- Learn and understand computers through the use of CLI
- Learn the tools such as cmake, git CLI 
- Move away from using an IDE and towards editors like vim

Side goals:
- Apply knowledge using WebGL to OpenGL
- Learn C++

This marks the start of a journey that I hope I can continue. And hopefully,
through this project, I can make something that I can proudly say: "damn that
shit's cool".
